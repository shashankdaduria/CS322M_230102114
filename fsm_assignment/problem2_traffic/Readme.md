**Traffic Light Controller (Verilog) – Overview**

This project implements a traffic light controller FSM in Verilog. The controller manages North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) traffic lights using a Moore finite state machine (FSM).

**The design ensures:**

Mutual exclusivity → Only one road has green/yellow at a time.

Timing sequence → NS and EW lights alternate between green → yellow → red.

Clock control → Controlled by a 1 Hz tick (1-second pulse) derived from the FPGA clock.

**FSM Logic States & Duration**

S_NS_G: 5 sec → NS = Green, EW = Red

S_NS_Y: 2 sec → NS = Yellow, EW = Red

S_EW_G: 5 sec → NS = Red, EW = Green

S_EW_Y: 2 sec → NS = Red, EW = Yellow
**Expected Behavior**

Simulation runs for 30 seconds.
The sequence of lights observed on North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) is:
| Time (sec) | NS Light | EW Light            |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 0–4        | Green    | Red                 |
| 5–6        | Yellow   | Red                 |
| 7–11       | Red      | Green               |
| 12–13      | Red      | Yellow              |
| 14–18      | Green    | Red                 |
| 19–20      | Yellow   | Red                 |
| 21–25      | Red      | Green               |
| 26–27      | Red      | Yellow              |
| 28–30      | Green    | Red (cycle repeats) |
