Sequence Detector (Mealy FSM)
Design

This project implements a Mealy FSM sequence detector in Verilog.
The detector looks for the bit-pattern:

Overlaps are allowed (e.g., input 1101101 will detect two sequences).

Output y goes HIGH (1) for one cycle when the pattern is recognized.

Testbench

The testbench (tb_seq_detect_mealy.v) drives a fixed bitstream into the DUT and logs waveforms using $dumpfile / $dumpvars.

Clock

Frequency: 100 MHz

Period: 10 ns

Reset

Held at 0 throughout (FSM is always active).
Input Bitstream
11011011101

###Expected Output 00010010001 Output 1 at the 4th , 7th , 11th clock pulses
